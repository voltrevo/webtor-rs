# Claim Dossier

> One dossier per distinct candidate breakthrough / formal claim.

---

## 1. Identification

- **Claim ID**: `CD-YYYYMMDD-001` (or similar)
- **Title / short description**:
- **Claim type**:
  - [ ] Conceptual hypothesis
  - [ ] Formal theorem / proposition
  - [ ] Algorithmic claim
  - [ ] Empirical scientific claim

- **Project type** (default to synthesis/pedagogy/tool unless clear novelty):
  - [ ] New scientific result / theorem
  - [ ] Research synthesis / reframing
  - [ ] Pedagogical / artistic project
  - [ ] Engineering workflow / tool

---

## 2. Origin & context

- **Proposed by** (user / collaborator / LLM-assisted):
- **Date & session(s)**:
- **LLM involvement**:
  - [ ] Brainstorming only
  - [ ] Heavy co-writing / derivations
  - [ ] Primarily human-generated, LLM used for editing
- **Initial motivation / problem being addressed**:

---

## 3. Precise statement

- **Formal or operational statement** (as precise as currently possible):

- **Definitions of key terms**:

- **Assumptions**:

---

## 4. Falsifiability & predictions

- **For empirical claims**:
  - Proposed experiments / studies:
  - Distinct predictions vs existing theories:

- **For math / logic**:
  - Domain, quantifiers, and structure:
  - Obvious small cases checked:

- **For algorithms**:
  - Input distribution:
  - Claimed complexity / performance:
  - Metrics and baselines:

---

## 5. Evidence & status

- **Current evidence type** (pick lowest applicable):
  - [ ] Pure speculation / intuition
  - [ ] Conceptual argument only
  - [ ] Toy examples / simulations
  - [ ] Pilot data / preliminary benchmarks
  - [ ] Robust experiments / formal proofs

- **Key supporting points**:

- **Key weaknesses / open questions**:

- **Current overall status**:
  - e.g. "Speculative, under-specified", "Promising but untested",
  "Partially verified in simple cases", "Formally proved", etc.
